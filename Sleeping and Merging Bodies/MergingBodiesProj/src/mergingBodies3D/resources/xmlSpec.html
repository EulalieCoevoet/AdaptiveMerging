<div width=500">
<p>The scene file has one<root></root> element that containing bodies and collision properties.

<p>&lt;body&gt; tags have required attributes:
	type: one of: box, mesh, sphere, plane
	name: anything you want, for debugging, need not be unique

<p>All bodies currently have unit density.  Different body types 
have required attributes that must appear after the tag:
<ul>	
<li>	box: <br/>
		dim="l w d" for x y z dimensions
<li>	mesh: <br/>
		scale="s" for a scale factor, 
		obj="fname.obj" for the mesh file,
		st="fname.sph" for the sphere tree file (undocumented)
<li>	plane: (always pinned) <br/>
		p="x y x" a point on the plane,
		n="x y z" the normal of the plane
</ul>
<p>The body element can contain elements with the following tags:
<ul>
<li>	&lt;x&gt; x y z &lt;/x&gt; <br/>
		Specifies translation, default is zero
<li>	&lt;R&gt x y z radians &lt;R&gt; <br/>
		Specifies rotation, default is identity
<li>	&lt;spring pB="x y z" k="ks" d="kd"/&gt; <br/>
		Attaches a zero length spring in given body coordinates
		to the world with given stiffness and damping.  The k
		and d attributes can be omitted in which case they will
		have default values.
<li>	&lt;pinned&gt; bool &lt;/pinned&gt;<br/>
		Default is false.
<li>	&lt;factorypart&gt; bool &lt;/factorypart&gt;<br/>
		Default is true, but set to false to not have the body
		persistent, like pinned bodies, and not be generated 
		randomly.
<li>	&lt;col&gt; r g b &lt;/col&gt;<br/>
		A body material colour with [0,1] RGB values.
</ul>
