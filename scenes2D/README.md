Scenes are built from 2D pixel art `.png` images:

- Red pixels are spring.
- Blue objects are pinned bodies.
- The shade of the color will change the density (dark for dense body).
- Green objects will be temporarily pinned.

This 2D implementation is inspired by 
[Cornell CS2643 rigid body contact assignment](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5643/2009sp/a3Rigidbody/) 
designed by Doug James. Examples are available in `scenes2D`.
